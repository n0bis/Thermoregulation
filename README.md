# Thermoregulation
Specific temperature conditions must be met when food is delivered. As a result, some mechanism must be in place to ensure that actions can be taken if food is delivered at temperatures that do not meet the requirements. Failure to achieve the rules will result in unhealthy food being discarded or even sold as such. How can we create a system that ensures that temperature measurements are made when food is carried and that if the temperature goes below the rules, you are notified and can take action.
